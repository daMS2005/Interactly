"Product has a distinct (garlic-type) odor, that is supposedly designed to ward off cats.  We've had a feral cat problem for a few months, and applied the product.  Within 2 days the cats could absolutely care less, and were all over our the place.  It basically did nothing for us.",1,1
It is so surprising that people who made Splenda Hazelnut Flavor did this one too. It has a bitter taste (in the bad sense) and a weird smell. Neither taste nor smell has any resemblance to mocha.,1,1
"How do I delete this item?? it was bad!!! The seal was broken and it look like and it was opened then resealed??? I love the kethcup.. but this.. I have found out it's not put out buy Heiz Dist,USA...:(((( maybe I just got a bad one though???",1,1
"I'm so sad.  I really wanted to like my sodastream.  The two sodas I drink all the time are Coke Zero and diet cream soda.  These two happen to be the worst tasting of the bunch, with the diet cream soda being so bad it's in a class of its own.  Tasted like perfume or gasoline or something.  I literally gagged.<br /><br />The whole thing is going back.  I knew it wasn't going to save me money but at least I'd stop drinking out of cans.  They are so far from comparable it is laughable.  Knock-off brands at Walmart or Aldi taste better.<br /><br />I'm so disappointed.",1,1
"I purchased this through Amazon and it was shipped from Starbucks.com.<br />I received the order promptly, however when I opened the shipping box, I found the product box with a round blue sticker over the broken seal that keep the product box sealed. Inside, there was coffee grounds all over the box and stuck to all the packets was this gritty stuff. There were 2 sleeves of VIA that were obviously opened and causing the mess in the box. Each of these packets also had a blue sticker! So it was pretty obvious that I was shipped a known defective product. When I called Starbucks, at first they wouldn't help me and treated me like they didn't ship this item (because I ordered thru Amazon) and would not replace this product. They said I would have to pay to ship it back to them and they would send a refund. I didn't want a refund, I just wanted the product replaced. They said that after I returned it, I would have to completely reorder and pay for the product. I called the customer service again and got the run-around. There customer service is awful. I guess they figure they can afford to lose a customer if they behave this way. That is why I am posting this review....<br />I would not recommend buying from Starbucks.",1,1
I understand that some of the coffee in assortment sampler packs with be decaf but a third of the pack was. I would not have bought it if I knew so much Decaf would come with it. Decaf in my house is unused coffee and thus a waste. Thanks for wasting my money.,1,1
"Why would you guys buy this stuff? Seriously, think about it.<br /><br />That's all I have to say.<br /><br />Get your meat locally and fresh. Stop cheating.",1,1
"This product has a terrible metallic after taste. No matter how I try to doctor it up, with extra sweeteners, flavored creamers, etc., the just awrful metallic taste comes through. The surprising thing, is, however, that the decaf version of this same product tastes much better.",1,1
"I somehow managed to drink one bottle (it was hot, I was  desperate).  It really tastes bad.  I have all the rest sitting in my cabinet, never to be sipped by me.  When I am dead, I'm sure they will be thrown away.  I know, what do I mean by ""bad.""  Well, I almost felt like I would get sick if I drank a whole bottle straight.  Maybe it is good for you, but the taste is so raunchy that I would have to be on a desert island to drink it.",1,1
Agree with the previous reviewer. Cheap taste! Starbucks VIA is waaaaay better! I don't have 20 more words to add to my review but amazon insists I do so here are some extra words to make 20!,1,1
"I love ginger snaps and was excited to try Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps.  At first taste you cannot distinguish these cookies from any other quality ginger snaps on the market.  They taste really good and have that amazing ""bite"" that real ginger gives.  Amazing.  Truly.<br /><br />Unfortunately the cookies cannot ride on flavor alone.  They are really hard.  So much so, that chewing them hurt my teeth (and I'm an ice cruncher, if that tells you anything).  I was chewing so hard on these that I bit my lip and inner cheek just trying to manage these snaps in my mouth.<br /><br />If I can get the exact same taste in another brand, but not mangle my mouth and give myself a headache while chewing, I will go with a different brand.",2,3
Mu husband uses this soap in the bathtub.  It smells great and cleans well.  But as the bathtub cleaner in the house I find that it leave alot of residue.  At first I thought he spilled some foam in the tub and then I saw the soap.  I use another brand and the tub was fine.  Then again tonight he used the  Dove soap again and it still left a large amount of residue.  We have used Dove products for years and this soap is the only one that ever left the tub and sink like this. I don't think we'll use the soap again.,2,1
The cookies taste like the cake snack called Devil Dogs.  They're very dry.  It's probably what chocolate dirt sprinkled with chocolate chips would taste like.  If you like Devil Dogs then you'll probably like these cookies.,2,2
"My wife and I each eat one ounce of walnuts daily and have for years.  We love them and appreciate their health benefits.  And for years, we've been buying Diamond brand walnuts from Sam's Club (currently about $12 for a 2 lb package, which use to be about $17.50 for a 3 lb package).  We thought that surely there were better walnuts available, so we ordered the Good Sense Organic Walnuts from Amazon.  Diamond brand has a lot of broken, shriveled and black colored walnuts.  The Good Sense Organic Walnuts are WORSE!  I would rate the Diamond walnuts 3 stars, just good, not great.  The Good Sense Organic Walnuts that we received are barely edible (small broken pieces, shriveled pieces, and dark colored pieces) which is why they've earned two stars.  By reading the reviews, we must be the only unlucky people that have ordered these walnuts.  My advice:  If you want big fresh delicious walnut halves, avoid these!  (Neither of us work for or are associated with Sam's Club or the Diamond nut company)",2,2
"At a time when the city was working on an old (by U.S. standards) water main just beyond my front door, and the water ran sandy instead of clear, I poured a pot of this, made with my last bottled water, down the drain.<br /><br />My little southern city has a few good tea sommeliers, and having had them offer Pu-erhs to me in very recent history, I'm here to tell you this is bad tea.  It's one note when it's actually liquid--molasses; then, with an overpowering smell of dead fish before it gets to your nose, this is nothing short of gross.<br /><br />Maybe I got a bad batch.<br /><br />For reference:  I'm a foodie by dint of food intolerances and, ironically, having to cook a lot in order to afford to eat out.  My favorite commercially available teas are Twinings' Oolong and Prince of Wales.  As pedestrian as that may be, at least they're not rotten.",2,1
"I bought this  product and when I opened it, I was disappointed to find many of the candies were left unwrapped throughout the box.",2,1
"Love the product, hate the shipper!  I discovered the coconut M&M's at a car wash and fell in love. My friends & I went on a hunt and were so pleased to find them on Amazon. I've ordered them before without a problem.  This time was a disaster!  The outside box was fine, but inside was a mess.  Most of the individual packages were not fully sealed resulting in unprotected, squashed &/or melted candy.  I returned them immediately and am awaiting a refund.  Although other reviewers mentioned this as an issue, I had to give it a shot.  What a disappointment!!",2,2
"Not my kind of coffee. it tastes weird and kinda smells funny. don't know why, but i just didn't have a good experience :(",2,1
At first I loved this popcorn but lately the smell is getting to me as it pops in the  microwave.  They make you order such a large volume and the shipping is quite costly.  I had to give a lot of it away for fear that it would go stale before I could  eat it all.  I recently switched to hot air popcorn because it doesn't have that odor that the microwaveable  ones put out.,2,2
"I have been riding for about 1.5 years  (average 30 - 40 miles - 17-18 mph).  Once I got over 25 miles decided to enhance my liquid replentishment with a solid - purchased these, ""GU"" gel and ""GU"" chomps all at the same time so I could try side by side.  All appeared to have helped me from hitting the wall equally, but the gel and chops go down easier.  These beans are smaller - thus need to ingest more/more often to make same impact and are ""tarter"" and not as easy to swallow.  I bought I case of these so will choke them down, but of the three, I like the chomps better.  Ride safe",2,3
"bacon sunflower seeds... sounds great, right? well i thought so too... but they put a little too much baconsalt on them, crazy right? but the paprika or whatever it is overpowers everything else & because of that i can only eat 3-4 seeds at atime.. big disappointment.",3,2
"I am a fan of these chocolate milk and a subscriber on Amazon. After stopping my subscription for a few month due to moving, I receive a 12 pack box in March. The packing has changed slightly that the place where to straw goes in has become a small hole just big enough for the straw.<br /><br />However, the most important thing is it taste different now. It seems to be less sweeter, but I don't like it. It taste more like Costco's Kirkland version.<br /><br />Otherwise, by mistake, I also receive another box of 18 from Amazon, and these have the same packaging as I used to get. The milk taste just as it used to be. I continue to order the 18-pack boxes and they have tasted the same so far. So I am not sure why the 12-pack taste different.",3,2
"as the rest...  Have been taking the product for over 3 weeks.  Didn't notice any improvement or change in anything, and it tastes AWFUL>",3,1
"I opened the package, sniffed and noticed a definite artificial cocoa smell.  It wasn't offensive, just not mouth-watering.  I love coffee and chocolate so was disappointed. I have tried Gevalia coffee beans (whole) in the past and they have been pretty good.<br /><br />I brewed using the suggestions on the box:  1 rounded tablespoon for every 6 ounces of water.  I use the ""pour over"" method to brew coffee every day because at this time, there is really only one non-commercial drip coffeemaker that gets water to the ideal brewing temperature of 192F to 204 F.  I used cold, filtered water, a Melitta natural brown filter and manual drip coffee filter.  I heated the water to boiling then used my instant read thermometer to make sure I had the correct water temp.  Then just pour the water over the ground beans.  There was some crema (the beautiful reddish brown foam) developing - not a lot but this is pre-ground and flavored coffee, so I didn't expect a lot.<br /><br />It smelled like good strong coffee but with a chemical background.  The artificial odors are not appetizing.  Tasted like strong coffee (which I like), only slightly bitter but again that artificial taste.  Then I tasted it with cream.  It was definitely better.  The cream seemed to cover up some of the fake chocolate flavor.<br /><br />It wasn't bad but it wasn't great.  If you are a flavored coffee drinker, you might like this brew. Would I purchase it in the future? Probably not. But I will finish this package and I wouldn't say no to a cup at a friend's house.  When I want chocolate coffee, I will brew a pot of unflavored coffee and add my favorite chocolate syrup and cream.",3,2
"I thought this would be a fun gift for my boyfriend's sister who is into cooking. I had read in many other reviews that the cans came dented.  For so reason I was hoping that this would be different for me.  Well, they arrived today.. dented.  One can isn't dented too bad and will still give as a gift.  The other can is too dented for me to consider gift-worthy.  I can't attest to the quality of the oil yet, because I haven't used it and nor has she.. I just wanted to get this review out to let people know that your cans will most like come dented in some way or an other.  In fact, mine came in a big box from Amazon with a few other purchases; Amazon seemed to wrap it well, but my guess is that the cans were dented before Amazon shipped them to me.",3,2
"I grew up with this kind of relish in Massachusetts. We called it Piccalilli.<br />The brand we used was Cain's.<br />Howard's is good but it would be much better if they didn't use high fructose corn syrup which is an additive widely used that is destroying the health of many people (obesity, diabetes, high blood sugar). Also Xanthan gum gives it an unctuous almost greasy texture. Cain's never used these additives back then and I hope doesn't use them today. That brand is not available here in Florida unfortunately, otherwise I would but that in preference to Howard's.",3,3
"The old product finally got rancid from age.  Folks used to rave about my popcorn, and the secret was the seasoning.  I tried some thing I bought at the local grocery and it is not good at all so I examined the container of the ""old"" stuff and found an web place and placed an order.  Seems like this new batch is not quite the same.  We will still use it and is far better than the POOR product I bought locally.  I'll try it out on company and see if anyone gets excited.<br />In a few words . . .what were my expectations?  More butter flavor.  Lots of product to use here, and not super cheep so not sure I want to experiment.",3,3
"I had ordered 3 packages of these back in June.  No problems! ! !<br />Now all of a sudden, they went from less than $12 a package to almost $18 a package.  A bit too steep of an increase for my blood.  I stopped by Wally world earlier on the weekend and they still have them for about half price.  So I grabbed a case for what they want for three envelopes.<br />Guess if your hardup and no way to get to town, go for it - however, if your looking to save a buck and heading out to wally world, wait for it!",3,3
"A neighbor raved about this cupcake mix so I thought I'd make if for my hubby's birthday.  It certainly was easy enough but...the bake time was more than the 20-22 minutes and my cupcakes didn't rise very well.  Old mix?  The buttercream frosting was very sweet and made as directed, did not seem thick enough to stay on the cupcake without sliding off.  The Lipitor advice?  This mix calls for three sticks of butter between the cake and the frosting!!!",3,2
"I found the coffee in a single serving pod to be pretty weak for an 8 oz cup.  Since I don't have this style of coffee maker, I opened the pods and poured them directly into the coffee filters I normally use to make coffee.  Two packages makes a pretty tasty, full bodied cup of coffee.<br /><br />My biggest concern with this product was the incredible amount of packaging for very little product.  15 small pouches of coffee, wrapped up like tea bags, each one individually packaged in a foil packet which are all placed in a fairly large box.  The box is wonderfully designed with multi-colored, foil embossed design (it would probably make a great gift for your favorite Bob Marley fan), but the amount of packaging is unbelievably excessive for, maybe, six or seven ounces of coffee.  The elaborate declarations of ""fair trade,"" ""ethical treatment of farm workers,"" ""biodiversity"" and ""sustainable cultivation"" (among other first world catchphrases) ring hollow for me.  This all may be true but it's hard not to be cynical and slightly suspicious of the true motivations for the lofty rhetoric on the box.<br /><br />The company's declaration of ""we believe that pure food from the earth is physically and spiritually beneficial,"" sounds absurd when compared to the amount of waste in the packaging of their product.  How pure can it really be after it has gone through this much processing?",3,1
its cheaper in the grocery stores and u can find $1 off coupons online and print as many of them as you want which means a 4 pk would be $10 bucks instead of $20.,4,4
very nostalgic... brought back many good memories... lots of laughs.. thank you!!!  1940's retro candy,4,4
"if you are into decaf and looking for a bold coffee flavor this is a great pick. Makes a nice cup of coffee in the morning, even without the caffeine to get you going.",4,4
"The black color may at first seem a tad unnerving, but one must get used to it or miss out on my favorite gum to date. The mint flavor seems to morph between types ranging from peppermint to wintergreen, and spearmint. It's soft, luscious, and juicy goodness. I would recommend this over the 5 react fruit flavor, as the taste lasts much longer in this.<br /><br />The reason I gave it 4 stars, not 5, is that you must beware your pockets! Even body heat is enough to (over the period of one day) heat this gum into a sticky putrefying mess.<br /><br />Other than that one problem, this is some of the best stick gum to date.",4,4
"Enjoyed the cinnamon flavor without all the bad calories. The flavor doesn't last terribly long, but how many gums do? A good value for the price. Will buy again.",4,4
"If you like the taste of whiskey, you'll like this sauce.  I don't use this sauce everyday, but the mood seems to hit me about once a week.",4,4
"he Clear brand dandruff shampoos seem to be everywhere now. They use pyrithione zinc to control dandruff, similar to other brands, but cost a bit more in my experience. If they work the same for dandruff control, then they can only differentiate themselves in fragrance, texture, and conditioning.<br /><br />FRAGRANCE<br /><br />Typical dandruff shampoos smell medicinal, but not bad. More expensive shampoos often have really strong invigorating smells like mint. This shampoo (Dry Scalp Hydration), with a price between the two extremes, also has a fragrance somewhere in the middle. It smells good, but is also very subtle.<br /><br />TEXTURE<br /><br />Another review nailed the texture as ""melted ice cream."" More importantly, it lathers well and is easy to spread through even long hair.<br /><br />CONDITIONING<br /><br />Shampoo+conditioner sometimes fails to do more than shampoo alone in my experience, and this is also true for the Complete Care version of this shampoo.  However, this Dry Scalp version does a good job of both cleaning and conditioning.  Ironically, my scalp does feel a little dry, but overall I am happy with it.  I may prefer a separate conditioner in the winter when my hair can get dryer and start looking frizzy.<br /><br />OVERALL<br /><br />Clear Dry Scalp Therapy shampoo+conditioner is pretty good and likely worth a small premium over traditional brands.  Since it uses the same ingredient for dandruff control, there is not much risk in trying it.",4,4
we will order again!our grandkids wanted to try caviar. We didn't want to spend a fortune if they did not like. we were actually pleasantly surprised with quality.,4,4
"I really love the idea of this coffee from the family of Bob Marley. However, it's packaged in individual pods that work in a Keurig adapter cup, so if you don't have that kind of coffee maker/adapter, this product isn't for you.<br /><br />Not wanting to waste the coffee, I cut up a bunch and brewed in a regular machine. Overall, it's a fairly mild roast with good strong coffee flavor (if you use enough of it) that has some nice fruity tones.",4,4
I really love olive tampanade and these chips brought the taste home; you can actually see the olives. They have an artisan quality in that they are the exact opposite of processed chips that all taste the same. I munched my sample bag down in mere seconds and decided to buy the full size package from Amazon. They get 4 stars instead of 5 to reflect the high cost per ounce.,4,4
"This is my favorite kind bar. It has a nice blueberry taste. I've found that blueberry is not a widely loved flavor, but if it is for you - you'll love this. Again - this is my favorite.",5,4
I have been looking for this meatloaf sauce for months.  I make a vegetarian meatloaf and this sauce is the best! Thank you for carrying this great product.,5,4
"My cats love their treats.  It helps them with tartar control as they eat a fair amount of soft food.  And of course, it can be used for positive reinforcement when they do something you ask.",5,4
"This was my first time to try anything with carnivorous plants. I looked around at a few websites about how to care for them, I am by no means an expert. Its been a month since I received my plant and it is thriving. Just follow the simple instructions and you will have a great plant. A word of warning though, don't expect a plant that looks like the pictures, that's just an example of what it will grow to look like. Also something I learned is that Venus Fly Traps will actually go dormant and look pretty much dead, but with some watering and sunlight they will come back just as healthy. After having the plant a little more than a month I'm already about to re-pot it into a larger pot. Great product, quick shipping from Hirt's. I just ordered a pitcher plant and sundew from them since I was so satisfied with my Fly Trap. I'd recommend this plant to anyone who likes unique things. I'm actually working on a CP garden to try and rid my backyard and deck of annoying bugs without spray or chemicals.<br /><br />Overall, Great buy at a great price.",5,4
"I bought this with the idea of grinding my sea salt. But since then I repurposed it to grind fennel seed. It worked beautifully for both uses. The grinder is smaller than some, and for me that is perfect. I also love the clear, true red color. I have used it steadily since October of last year and it is working well. It adjusts grind size easily and the ceramic blade is great! So today I am back for another one to keep in my picnic basket, and we will use it for pepper.",5,4
"I eat 2 or 3 boxes a week of various brands and varieties of similar boxed potato with cheese products: potatoes au gratin, scalloped potatoes, etc.  I recently discovered these and they are now my favorite of this ilk.  I know taste is highly personal but, to me, these are the best-tasting.  It could be just some artificial flavoring in the sauce mix, but I don't care - I just like them.  And I also like that they leave the skin on.<br /><br />I'm glad to find them here, especially with Prime shipping.  These can be hard to find in my grocery stores.  Several times I have thought this is what I was buying, only to get home and discover it wasn't quite the same thing, such as the same brand ""scalloped potatoes in a creamy sauce"" which box looks almost an exact match but doesn't taste quite as good.<br /><br />P.S. For stove-top preparation, I find the instructions make it too runny so I use a bit less water.  And I add about a half cup of not-fat instant milk powder for added protein without noticing any taste difference.",5,4
"I just love these things!  Bob's are the best!  They are the softest and always fresh.  Some of the other brands taste like they've been sitting on the shelves for two years.  I bought a big ""tub"" of them a couple of weeks before Christmas and we're still munching on them.  The holidays wouldn't be the same without them.",5,5
"Essentia 9.5 PH Drinking water is a bottled water made with good digestive health in mind. It takes the ordinary concept of bottled water a few steps further by adding calcium chloride, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulphate, and sodium bicarbonate. It then elevates the PH for better digestion and the reverse osmosis and purification via micro- filtration help make for the cleanest possible taste.<br /><br />We have all heard recommendations from experts that bottled water is a bunch of hype and not worth the money and for the most part I agree with this assessment. The majority of bottled waters on the market are nothing special and not worth the expenditure. But there are some bottled waters that are enhanced in ways that make them better and Essentia is one of them. The added minerals and improved processes help elevate this water to a level not matched by most bottled water products. The higher PH makes the product more alkaline and this suits someone like me very well, since I sometimes suffer from acid reflux. After a heavy meal, my stomach actually feels better if I drink this water.<br /><br />As for the taste, I find it very smooth and clean- the way water should taste. I have taste-tested this, side by side, against the water that comes out of my water filter pitcher and I can say that, while both taste good, this product is a little cleaner and smoother in flavor. It does cost more than the water out of my water filtered pitcher, but the taste is a little bit better.<br /><br />Essentia is packaged in BPA free plastic bottles and it is made with environmental concerns in mind. Combine that with the taste and improvements in digestion and you have a clear, bottled- water winner in my book.",5,4
"Dark Magic is one of my two favorite k-cups (the other is Green Mountain Sumatran Reserve).  But this is way overpriced at 24 k-cups for 23.49.  I can get 12 k-cups for 6.99 at my local supermarket, why would I buy from Amazon at twice the price?  (And I buy EVERYTHING from Amazon).",5,3
Wonderful! These granola bars are amazing! They are a more portable version of my favorite Bakery on Main granola. The flavors complement each other so well. I love them!,5,5
